### Hello and welcome to my repo!

I am just enthusiastic about tech in general. My educational background is in Architecture and Design. It was all fine and good until I slowly dabbled with 3D printing, and that led me deeper into the rabbit hole of engineering. I enjoy going head-first into projects, learning and obtaining the tools and skills as I go.

Below are things I am currently learning and working on:

1. Personal Website Project
2. End-to-End Machine Learning Projects
3. End-to-End Data Engineering Projects
4. PowerBI & Tableau Dashboards
5. Web Apps
6. Various Data Science Jupyter Notebooks

I am always eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts and professionals. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or collaboration opportunities. You can contact me via my [website](https://jbrienweb.dev).
